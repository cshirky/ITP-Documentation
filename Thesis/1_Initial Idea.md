# Thesis Idea for ITP

Prompt: For week 1, write. a short blog post on the big concept or passion or interest or questions you want to tackle with your thesis and why.

### The Journey of Learning, or the Learning Journey

Recently, through Clay Shirky's class in *Imagination and Distributed Learning*, I have started to embark on a lot of theories of learning. To be more specific, my research focuses on methodologies for peer-to-peer, nonhierarchical, noninstitutional learning. I am inspired by the theories and would love to take the research into a format where it can be expressed in a more approachable way.

### Why about learning?

The model of learning from peers has been a topic of interest for me because of the fact that I have found it difficult to pursue education after I left an academic setting after my undergraduate studies. While the pathways for learning in institutions are the most straightforward and obvious, they are often not sustainable in terms of longevity and cost of tuition. What if we could learn from the community and people that surround us? What if learning is a mindset that we have all the time, instead of thinking of it as something that we have to actively pursue at a designated time? I am hoping to do academic research in this area and distill the core learnings down into a story for my thesis project.

### The Initial Idea

My passion in life is learning, and I want to tell a story centered on that theme. My current thoughts are that I would write and illustrate an interactive story about learning, based on research that I will do beforehand. The story will have elements of a traditional story, with narratives and characters. However, where I'm hoping it will shine is through the interactive aspect. I envision the story taking on the format of a website or an app, where viewers can navigate the story through interaction.
