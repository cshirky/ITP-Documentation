# Expanding Ideas for Thesis


### The Journey of Learning, or the Learning Journey

### Summary of Idea
My passion in life is learning, and I want to illustrate a story that expresses different ways people can learn.

### Research

The research about the model of learning I want to portray is logged in an extensive blog post linked [here](https://github.com/lynneyun/ITP-Documentation/blob/master/Imagination_and_Distributed_Learning/Lifelong%20Continuous%20Nonhierarchical%20Model%20of%20Learning.md).
 
### Existing Similar Projects

#### Examples:

* [Jess and Russ](http://jessandruss.us)

* [Canals of Amsterdam](https://canals-amsterdam.nl) - Fun Typography & Editorial Layout

* [Tracing the future of web design, through the history of art](https://webflow.com/web-design-art-history) by Webflow

* [The Story of the Goonies](https://the-goonies.webflow.io) - Nice initial zooming effect 

#### How will mine be different?
I'm hoping to take a fun, illustrative, typographic spin on the project.

#### Audience

Ideally, it will be for people who have finished secondary/higher education. I hope it can serve as inspiration for them to keep their enthusiasm for learning.

#### Where will it be / How will you implement the project??

It will be on the web, optimized for desktop and tablet.

#### What is the nature of the interaction?

The interaction will primarily be through navigating a sequence of scenes (currently envisioned as a long scroll)
