# Learning as Practice

### Why do I like to learn? 

* It's fun, it makes me feel safe. It feels like a very safe hobby, and empowering at the same time. There is also an addictive quality to it. It makes me feel like I am not stagnant.

* Learning is also often a semi-social activity, and allows us to be part of a community. 

### Pitfalls of "leaderless" Learning:
	* Not structured, prone to falling stagnant/loss of motivation
	* no obvious "measure of success"

### Cons of Traditional Teaching Model

* student-as-customer/consumer model is problematic.
* cost is higher as one person is continually devoting time for teaching
* structure is not flat, leading to "weighted" voices/opinions (e.g. master/apprentice model)
* requires students to know what they want to learn already, and for teachers to guess what students want to learn in advance of the learning itself.
