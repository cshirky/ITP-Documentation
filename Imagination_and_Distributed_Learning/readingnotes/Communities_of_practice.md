# Communities of Practice

Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.

Three characteristics are crucial for a CoP (Community of Practice):

* **The domain**: It has an identity defined by a shared domain of interest.
* **The community**
* **The practice**: participants are practitioners

* Common Characteristics of a community of practice: autonomy, practitioner-orientation, informality, crossing boundaries, organic, spontaneous. They set their own agendas and establish their own leadership. Membership is self-selected (they know if they have something to give, and whether they are likely to take something away). 

* The strength of communities of practice is self-perpetuating. As they generate knowledge, they reinforce and renew themselves. 

* Although CoP are informal and self-organizing, they benefit from cultivation. Like gardens, they respond to attention that respects their nature.
