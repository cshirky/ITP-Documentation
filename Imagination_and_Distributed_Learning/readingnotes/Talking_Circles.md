# Talking Circles as a Metaphor and Pedagogy for Learning

* ‘Integrative conversation’ involves the exchange and creation of new meaning and feelings of cohesion. It requires that individuals become part of a bigger story, creating a meaning in concert with all others rather than any select subset. An integrative conversation is a genuine exchange of ideas, feelings, perspective and so forth, where each person involved there emerges a sense of self as part of the whole. The dynamics of power are inclusive, interconnected, and fluid. 

* There exists a growing awakening these days to the possibility that mainstream structures and processes of learning inadequately support organizational and societal needs. 

* Talking Circles begin with an identification of purpose and someone taking the lead to talk.

* Thinking critically means relating to course material and to our environments in ways that enable us to understand both explicit and implicit meaning. It is having the ability to switch contexts and to develop self-awareness and self-assent along the way. These competencies are gained only from adequate exposure, sustained practice, and accumulated experience... A common theme in developmental psychology is that experience has the ability to change us fundamentally, I.e., to change our personalities, actions, thoughts, beliefs, and values. Accordingly, developmental change is measured by an ability to interpret, to synthesize, and to integrate what is occurring around is broadly and within us deeply.
