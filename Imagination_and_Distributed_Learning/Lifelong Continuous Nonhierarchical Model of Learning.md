# Research Project: A Lifelong, Continuous, Nonhierarchical Model of Learning

**Summary**: 

## Background

Continuing to learn after a formal educational environment is a challenge for many people, myself included. In a formal setting, there is often a secluded environment where cohorts of students are allowed to experiment, fail, and share learned experiences. Upon graduation, often people lose this sheltered environment. Although the desire for learning is still there, people are left in the dark, wondering how they could actively continue learning.  


###Common pathways of adult learning (and their failures):
(Note: These list conscious, intentional learning, and does not include unconscious learning)

* Continuing Education Courses via Institutions:
	* Often surface level due to not enough common ground of expertise
	* Hierarchical learning model (teacher/student) is not conducive to continued learning after course ends
* Conferences:
	* Often focused on networking as opposed to learning
	* Distracting environment
	* Information is bite-sized/brief
* Workplace:
	* Priority is usually on commercial output 
	* 'Being on the clock' discourages novel/experimental approaches
	* Motivation for learning can be stunted by external forces (clients, deadlines, coworkers, etc)

## Questions for Research

* How can we continue to engage in active learning after higher education?
* How can we learn in meaningful ways from our peers?
* What research/documentation has been done before in this area, and what can we learn from it?


## Potential Applications for Research

In the era of the pandemic, we are realizing that online meetups and conferences can be organized by anyone. These learnings can be beneficial in current times where digital conferences/meetups can be hosted by any individual/group.
