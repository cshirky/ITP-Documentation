# Research and Proposal for a Peer-to-Peer Model of Learning

**Summary**: My final project will be on research on the topic of learning as part of a community among peers. The project will take on the form of a long form written piece. The feedback that I will need is for someone to read my written draft and ask any further questions or give me advice about gaps I may need to fill. 

### Initial Thoughts

Continuing to learn after a formal educational environment is a challenge for many people, myself included. In a formal setting, there is often a secluded environment where cohorts of students are allowed to experiment, fail, and share learned experiences. Upon graduation, often people lose this sheltered environment. Although the desire for learning is still there, people are left in the dark, wondering how they could continue learning. Professional conferences and short-term workshops sometimes fill this gap, but mostly in a fleeting manner. There is also another barrier to consider: As one progresses in professional life, there is a desire for a more specialized or advanced learning, which can be difficult to find or cost prohibitive. Lifelong, continuous education should not be inaccessible.

### Initial Proposal

A new model for learning amongst professional peers needs to be examined. 

My initial thoughts involved designing a part-time online residency program for a small group of peers, with a rotational educator and student model. A group would commit to 12 weeks of learning, and each person would take on the role of educator for one week. This way, the cost of admission can be reduced since everyone takes on the burden of being a teacher, and a certain level of engagement is ensured. 

Upon talking with Clay during office hours, I realized that perhaps my project could be better started off as a research project into similar attempts that had been done before. Right now, my work is trying to compile and go through relevant papers and research.

#### Readings from Brendan Schlagel @ SFPC:

* [Skillshares: Peers in Practice by Distributed Web of Care](https://dwc-tchoi8.hashbase.io/posts/skillshares/)
		* It was an event listing (so not relevant)
* [The Antidisciplinarathon](https://hypotext.co/antidisciplinarathon)
	* "A discipline is an area of comfort and expertise; an antidiscipline is an area of curiosity, ignorance, boredom, or fear. We wanted to pair people who had complementary disciplines and antidisciplines and see what they could create."
	* This article is a documentation of a 'hackathon' style event that happened over 90 minutes. 
	* The event had two stages: collaborate (90 min) & present (3 min for each group).
	* The organizers emphasized "depth over breadth" and bold, experimental, illegible, or exploratory work. More details are in the [handout](http://hypotext.co/resources/antidisciplinarathon_handout.pdf).
* [The Elephants](https://medium.com/things-ive-written/the-elephants-182870501589#.c9hu0lean)
